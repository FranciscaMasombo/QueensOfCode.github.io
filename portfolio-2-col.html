“What is necessary to change a person is to change his awareness of himself.”<br>
“If you plan on being anything less than you are capable of being, you will probably be unhappy all the days of your life.”<br>
“If you only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.”<br>
“The ability to be in the present moment is a major component of mental wellness.”<br>
“What a man can be, he must be. This need we call self-actualization.”<br>
“A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he is to be ultimately at peace with himself.”</p>

<h3>
B. F. Skinner
</h3>
“When you run into something interesting, drop everything else and study it.”<br>
“I did not direct my life. I didn’t design it. I never made decisions. Things always came up and made them for me. That’s what life is.”<br>
“The way positive reinforcement is carried out is more important than the amount.”<br>
“A failure is not always a mistake, it may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying.”

<h3>
Carl Jung

</h3>
“Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.”<br>
“As far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle a light in the darkness of mere being.”<br>
“A man who has not passed through the inferno of his passions has never overcome them.”<br>
“In all chaos there is a cosmos, in all disorder a secret order.”<br>
“There is no coming to consciousness without pain.”<br>
“The word 'happiness’ would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness.”<br>
“Knowing your own darkness is the best method for dealing with the darknesses of other people.”<br>
“We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect. The judgement of the intellect is only part of the truth.”<br>
“It all depends on how we look at things, and not how they are in themselves.”<br>
“Follow that will and that way which experience confirms to be your own.”<br>
“Nobody, as long as he moves about among the chaotic currents of life, is without trouble.”<br>
“The least of things with a meaning is worth more in life than the greatest of things without it.”<br>
“Knowledge rests not upon truth alone, but upon error also.”<br>
“Man needs difficulties; they are necessary for health.”<br>
“We cannot change anything until we accept it. Condemnation does not liberate, it oppresses.”<br>
“Mistakes are, after all, the foundations of truth, and if a man does not know what a thing is, it is at least an increase in knowledge if he knows what it is not.”<br>
“The most intense conflicts, if overcome, leave behind a sense of security and calm that is not easily disturbed. It is just these intense conflicts and their conflagration which are needed to produce valuable and lasting results.”<br>
“Man is not a machine that can be remodeled for quite other purposes as occasion demands, in the hope that it will go on functioning as regularly as before but in a quite different way. He carries his whole history with him; in his very structure is written the history of mankind.”

<p> <h3>Erik Erikson</h3>

“The more you know yourself, the more patience you have for what you see in others.”<br>
“We are what we love.”<br>
“I am what survives of me.”<br>
“Life doesn’t make any sense without interdependence. We need each other, and the sooner we learn that, the better for us all.”<br>
“In the social jungle of human existence, there is no feeling of being alive without a sense of identity.”
“The way you ‘take history’ is also a way of 'making history.'”</p>
