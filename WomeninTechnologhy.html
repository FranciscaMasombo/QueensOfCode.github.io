                 <p>Katherine Coleman Goble Katherine Coleman  was born on the 26 of August 1918, she is still alive today. She is an American mathematician, physicist and space scientist. She worked on the United States' aeronautics and space programs. She also worked on the early application of digital electronic computers at NASA.  This is what helped NASA with there navigation system, it helped them land on the noon. She helped then calculate the launch windows,emergency back-up return paths and speeds which the rocket should take, this is klnow as computerized celestial navigation.
                  SHe worked on project like Mercury and early NASA missions of John Glenn, Alan Shepard, the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the Moon and continued work through the Space Shuttle program and on early plans for the Mission to Mars.</p>
                            <p>Katherine Katherine Coleman  was born in 1918.Her parents were Joshua Coleman and Joylette Coleman. She was born in White Sulphur Springs in West Virginia.Her parents had 4 children. Her father worked at a hotel in west Virginia he was a had man there. Her mother Joylette Coleman was a teacher.Early on,so her parents emphasized the importance of education. At the in Greenbrier County black students where not allowed to go school pass the eighth grade. So Katherine Coleman and her sisters and brother attended the rest of there schooling in the Institut of Kanawha County, West Virginia. </p>

                            <div class="col-lg-12"> <p>Katherine Coleman graduated from high school at age of 14 and at the age 15 and she started going to West Virginia State College. Katherine Coleman took every math course the college offered.  Multiple professors took Katherine Coleman  under their wings, including chemist and mathematician Angie Turner King, who had also mentored Katherine Coleman  throughout high school, and W.W. Schiefflin Claytor, the third African American to receive a PhD in math. The the collage even made a new maths  course just for her. She graduated summa cum laude in 1937 with two degrees one in maths and one in French, at just the of age 18. After she graduated she became a teacher.

                            Katherine Coleman  decided she wanted a career in mathematics, main goal was to be a research mathematician. This industry at the time would have been very had for to get into for African American women and women in general at the time. The first jobs she could find were in teaching. A relative mentioned that the (NACA) National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics now known as the NASA, was looking for people. They were recently open to hiring African American women for their Guidance and Navigation Department. Katherine Coleman  was offered a job in 1953, and she accepted it and became part of the early NASA team.
                            <br>

                        she worked in a pool of technical women performing math calculations, known as computors. Katherine has referred to the women in the pool as virtual "computers who wore skirts." Their main job was to read the data from the black boxes of planes and carry out other precise mathematical tasks. Then one day, Katherine and her friend were temporarily assigned to help the all-male flight research team. Katherine's knowledge of analytic geometry helped make quick allies of male bosses and colleagues to the extent that "they forgot to return me to the pool." While the racial and gender barriers were always there, Katherine says she ignored them.  She simply told people she had done the work and that she belonged. </p>
                            <p>
                         From 1953 through 1958, Katherine Coleman  worked as a "computer", doing analysis for topics such as gust alleviation for aircraft. Originally assigned to the West Area Computers section which was supervised by mathematician Dorothy Vaughan, she was reassigned to the Guidance and Control Division of Langley's Flight Research Division. Katherine Coleman  and other African American women in the computing pool were also identified as "colored computers" and subject to workplace segregation, working, eating and using restrooms apart from their white peers until the colored computing pool was disbanded in 1958. From 1958 until she retired in 1986, she worked as an aerospace technologist. She later moved to the Spacecraft Controls Branch. She calculated the trajectory for the space flight of Alan Shepard,the first American in space, in 1959. She also calculated the launch window for his 1961 Mercury mission.She plotted backup navigational charts for astronauts in case of electronic failures.[citation needed] In 1962, when NASA used electronic computers for the first time to calculate John Glenn's orbit around Earth, officials called on her to verify the computer's numbers because Glenn asked for her personally and refused to fly unless Katherine verified the calculations.Katherine Coleman  later worked directly with digital computers. Her ability and reputation for accuracy helped to establish confidence in the new technology. She calculated the trajectory for the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the Moon.During the moon landing, Katherine Coleman  was at a meeting in the Pocono Mountains. She and a few others crowded around a small television screen watching the first steps on the moon. In 1970, Katherine Coleman  worked on Apollo 13's mission to the Moon. Once the mission was aborted, Katherine Coleman 's work on backup procedures and charts helped safely return the crew to Earth four days later. Later in her career, she worked on the Space Shuttle program, the Earth Resources Satellite, and on plans for a mission to Mars. </p>

                        Hedy lamarr along with co-inventor George Anthiel, developed a "Secret Communications System" to help combat the Nazis in World War II. By manipulating radio frequencies at irregular intervals between transmission and reception, the invention formed an unbreakable code to prevent classified messages from being intercepted by enemy personnel.
