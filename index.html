             <h2>Introduction </h2> 
             <p>
The purpose of this project is to introduce crowdfunding. I am going to discuss what it is, where you can get it and its benefits. I will also mention its drawbacks as well. I am going to also going to talk about one crowdfunding website in detail. I will then go on to describe how crowdfunding operates and what type of crowdfunding it gives. I will evaluate on project on the website.  </p>
<h2>Crowdfunding  </h2>
<p>
Crowdfunding is a new way of raising funds and capital for a new projects or ventures. The funding is raised by large numbers of people, they give small amounts of money to an entrepreneur and its done mostly over the internet. Its estimated the over 4 billion is raised each year due to crowdfunding.  </p> 
<h2>How Crowdfunding Works </h2>
<p>
Crowdfunding has created the opportunity for entrepreneurs to raise capital from anyone who has money to invest. Crowdfunding websites such as Kickstarter and fundit attract thousands of people hoping to invest in the next big thing. Crowdfunding provides a forum to anyone with an idea to be able to sell it in front of waiting investors. </p>
<h3>The types of crowdfunding </h3>
<p>

There are two different types of crowdfunding models. This is what the investors get back.  <br>
1. Rewards based (also called non-equity crowdfunding) 
The investors may get the product itself or some can of gift. For example, TLC a former girl band had a Gofundme campaign to help them with their tour. If you invested $20 you got a t-shirt, if you invested $50 or more you got a cd and a t-shirt and if you 
PAGE 4 
invested $1000 you got a personally written note and a concert ticket.  <br>
2. Equity based  
This allows small business and startups to get capital without giving up control to venture capital investors. It offers investors the opportunity to earn equity from the venture. The return with this type of crowdfunding usually takes 2-10 year. For example, for Angel investors given a holding period of just under 4 years the overall return is approximately a 22 per cent gross Internal Rate of Return. Only the company doesn’t close down. 56 percent of the business fails to return capital, 44 percent generate more that the initial investment and 9 percent of the businesses make 10 times the money which was invested. 
  <br>
  <h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>

The are many benefits to crowd funding. <br> 
1. It helps companies grow the client base. Depending on the website it gives the company the ability to tell people about their idea and message. Potential investors can help spread the initial word without asking for anything in return. <br>
2. It provides Capital. Sometimes proper investors are a bit hesitate to invest in young or new entrepreneurs. So crowdfunding is a great alternative to banks, venture capitalists or investors.  <br>
3. Ventures can be funded without giving back equity or getting deep in debt. <br>
4. The websites also work as a marketing tool. The project gets traffic from everywhere especially if the project is spread through social media.  
PAGE 5 <br>
5. It also helps the entrepreneurs proof their concept. If people are willing to help the entrepreneurs with his or her concept it must mean they have a good idea.  <br>
6. These websites are usually 100% free. </p>
 
<h2>Disadvantages  </h2>
<p>
There are several disadvantages to crowdfunding.<br>

1. The many one is the fact that not all projects that apply to crowdfunding website may not get funding at all.  <br>
2. When you are on the website you need to really built up a social media presents and public interest.  <br>
3. If you set a certain funding target on most websites, you have to meet the target or you will not get the funding at all. <br> 
4. if you haven’t protected your idea with a patent or copyright, someone might see it on a crowdfunding site and steal your idea. <br>
5. You might get embarrassed if you fail to reach you target. 
 </p>

<h2>Kickstarter </h2>
<p>
Kickstarter is crowdfunding website. Kickstarter helps artists and creators find the resources and support they need to make their ideas a reality. It has the two crowdfunding return models both Rewards based and equity based </p>
<h3>How it works? </h3>
<p>
 Thousands of project are funded on Kickstarter, each project is created by one person or group of person. They spend weeks building their 
project pages, making videos and thinking of what rewards they are going to give their investors. After they finish their project page they will launch it on to the website and share in with-in their community. Every project has to have a project funding goal they have to reach the goal by a set deadline. When people see the project page they have to make a decision to whether they want to invest in the project or not. If the page gets enough backers and reach its goal funding the start-up can then go ahead with their project, but if they fail to get their goal funding the people who invested will get their money back.   </p>

It’s a desk toy to help stop fidgeting and help people focus. It will retail for $25. You can use it at work, on the go, in class, studding, in a meeting and watching tv. Fidget Cube has six sides spin, click, glide, 

breathe, roll and flip. It comes in 10 different colours. It is made to replicate a pen by click and rolls. They wanted an investment of $15000, they posted their project in august 2016 and they now have $5,617,617 raised so for the project page still has 13 days to go. You can pledge $1 to show love, if you pledge $14 or more you can get a fidget cube, if you pledge $35 or more you can get 2 fidget cube, if you pledge $79 or more you can get 5 fidget cube and if you pledge $849 or more you can get 80 fidget cube. 
I personal think this is a good idea. They got 50 times the capital they needed. This proves that crowdfunding really works.

<h2>Conclusions  </h2>
<p>
I personal think crowdfunding is a good idea. For start-ups this could be the best way to get funding. It’s can of a luck game if your idea is heavily published you are more likely to get funding  </p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2> <p> The purpose of this project is to introduce Activist Investor. I will discuss the concept in detail. This report reviews agency theory applied to a start-up and small business finance.  
Activist Investor (angel and vc investors) Activist Investor is when a group or an individual buys many shares of a public company and obtains seats on the company’s board. They are usually trying to influence the company as it progresses in its growth. A company can become a target for activist investors if it is going under, if the cost of the shares has gone down.  
The company could be run more profitably as a private company or has another problem that the activist investor believes it can fix to make the company more valuable. Private equity firms, hedge funds and wealthy people are types of entities that might decide to act as activist investors. Activist shareholders engage in their business activities through their holding companies or hedge funds. </p>

<h3>There are two types of Activist Investors Angel investors and venture capitalist. </h3><p>
Angel investors  An angel investor is a wealthy person willing to invest in a company at its earlier stages in exchange for an ownership stake, often in the form of preferred stock or convertible debt for example of dragon den. If you have a startup you can pitch your idea in front of an angel investor. You can then negotiate the number of shares or the percentage of the company the investors can own. 
The advantages of angel investing  Can provide capital for a startup. Ability to raise capital in small amounts. Flexible business agreements can bring knowledge and experience to a new company Involved in high risk investments. </p>
 
 
<p>
The disadvantages of angel investing Hardly ever do the investors come back and make an investment. Can be misleading the investor could be a liar they might invest and take over your company. Can be costly if you must pay the investor back. Active company involvement can lead to problems. Do not have national recognition.  
Venture capital Is a type of finance, investors offer to startup companies and small businesses that are believed can be profitable in the future. For startups without access to capital markets, venture capital is an important source of money. Risk is typically high for investors, but the downside for the startup is that these venture capital investors usually get a say in company decisions because they will own some of the business. </p>
<h2>
Advantages
</h2>
<p>1. Business expertise The investors most likely will have business experience because they are usually in the business sector. 
<br>
2. Additional resources They might know people in business who have connections in other areas, which you can use to your advantage. </p>
<h2>Disadvantages </h2>
 <p>
 Loss of control This is one of the main draw backs of Venture capital, must likely the investor has invested but also bought so percentage of number of shares of your business </p>
<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>I think the type of finance should be your last choice. You give up a lot more control of your business. I think this is not good for a startup especially when you are just funding yourself. It has its up sides like the fact that you don’t have to pay the investors back this could depend on your contact, in some arrangements you 

might have to meet certain target or make a certain amount of revenue each year. </p>
